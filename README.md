<h1> Azure Conditional Access + MFA Enforcement Lab </h1>

<h2> Description: </h2>

This lab demonstrates how to configure and enforce Conditional Access policies in Azure AD, including MFA setup and blocking legacy authentication. It simulates real-world identity protection strategies used to secure cloud access.

<h2>Tools used: </h2>
  
- Microsoft Azure Free Account

- Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)

- Conditional Access Policies

- Azure MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

- Sign-in Logs (Azure AD > Monitoring)

- Azure Monitor (optional, for log visualization)

<h2> What security outcome was achieved: </h2>
Identity is the new perimeter in cloud environments. This project demonstrates how to implement and enforce secure access policies using Azure AD Conditional Access and MFA. It highlights my ability to reduce unauthorized access risks, respond to modern threats, and manage identity securely in a cloud-first infrastructure.
